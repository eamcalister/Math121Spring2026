            In this activity we will do the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
	  		<li>
	  			<p>
					Show that formulas for exponential functions to fit two points on the graph can be found easily using horizontal transformations.

	  		</li>
            <!--li>
                <p>
                    Interpret the continuous growth rate of an exponential function as a horizontal compression/stretch factor.
                </p>
            </li-->
            <li>
                <p>
                    Apply our knowledge to solve real-world problems.
                </p>
            </li>

    </objectives>
            <introduction>
                <p>
                    In this activity we will see some ways in which graphical transformations can make some previously difficult problems easier. Please feel free to work together. If you get stuck, just ask and we'll get unstuck.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note, some of these questions have answers that will require you to write complete sentences in order to help you make better sense of the math you're learning. This may seem difficult at first.

                         Recall that in <xref ref="week1prob3">Week 1 Activity - Exercise</xref>  we found a formula for the exponential function passing through the points <m>(1,4)</m> and <m>(5,12)</m> by solving a system of equations. The formula was 
                         <me>
                            f(x) = \frac{4}{\sqrt[4]{3}}(\sqrt[4]{3})^x.
                         </me>
                        We can build that same function starting with the base function
                         <me>
                            g(x) = 4(3)^x.
                         </me>
                        We chose this function because <m>4</m> is the <m>y</m>-value of the initial point (<m>(1,4)</m>) and the <m>3</m> is the <em>ratio</em> of the <m>y</m>-values of the later point over the earlier point (<m>12/4</m>). The graph of <m>g(x)</m> passes through the points <m>(0,4)</m> and <m>(1,12)</m>, and we can apply transformations so that the resulting function passes through the given points <m>(1,4)</m> and <m>(5,12)</m>.
                    </p>
                </introduction>
                <task workspace="1.5in">
                    <statement>
                        <p>
                            Give the explicit formula for the transformation of <m>g(x)</m> that stretches the point <m>(1,12)</m> to <m>(4,12)</m> while leaving the <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0,4)</m> fixed. (This makes the horizontal spacing of the two points equal to the horizontal spacing of the ones at the beginning of the problem). Sketch the graph of this new function, with any important points labeled, on the axes provided on the next page.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now describe the next transformation that places <m>(0,4)</m> and <m>(4,12)</m> in the desired positions (<m>(1,4)</m> and <m>(5,12)</m>, respectively) from the beginning of this problem. Give the formula both explicitly and in terms of <m>g(x)</m>. Now sketch the graph of your final function on the axes provided.

    Once you can find a formula for an exponential function that looks like
    <me>
        f(t) = a\cdot b^{\frac{t-h}{P}}
    </me>
    recall that you can always replace <m>b</m> with <m>e^{k}</m> where <m>k = \ln(b)</m>. Thus,
    <me >
        f(t) = a e^{{\frac{k(t-h)}{P}}}.
