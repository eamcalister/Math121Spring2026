        This activity has the following objectives:

            <li>
                <p>
                    Find limits from graphs and equations

                <p>
                    Please note, some of these questions have answers that will require you to write complete sentences in order to help you make better sense of the math you're learning. This may seem difficult at first.

                In this project (and often in calculus), we will work with limits.

We have seen limits in the context of long-run behavior. We saw that <m> \displaystyle \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x)</m> was the value <m>f(x) </m> approached as <m> x </m> got very large. More formally, this means that <m> \displaystyle \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L </m> if, for any small positive number, <m> \varepsilon,</m> we can find a large number <m> N </m> so that for all <m> x \geq N , f(x)</m> never gets more than <m> \varepsilon </m> away from <m> L .</m>

      Let's demonstrate this with the function <m> f(x) </m> whose graph is given in the Geogebra interactive below. What does it look like <m> \displaystyle L = \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) </m> is?

      Similarly, we can take limits as <m> x </m> approaches a finite value, <m> a.</m> In this case, instead of taking larger values of <m> x </m> to get close to <m> L ,</m> we take values <em> closer </em> to <m> a .</m> Specifically,

          <p>
            If we are given a function <m>f</m> and a number <m> a, </m> we say that <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L </m> if we can make <m>f(x) </m> as close to <m>L</m> as we would like by taking values of <m> x</m> sufficiently close to, but not equal to, <m> a, </m> i.e. <m> L </m> is the value <m> f(x) </m> approaches as <m> x </m> approaches (but does not equal) <m> a .</m>

         Using the Geogebra graph from the previous problem, find <m> f(4.8), f(4.9), f(5.2), f(5.1) </m> and use these to estimate <m> \displaystyle \lim_{x \to 5} f(x).</m>

  Draw the graph of <m> g.</m> Label the <m> x</m> and <m> y </m> intercepts as well as any holes. Use Desmos to check your answer.
